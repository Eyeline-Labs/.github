# Eyeline Research

This is the official website for Eyeline Research, the research division of [Eyeline Studios](https://www.eyelinestudios.com/), powered by **Netflix**, where creativity meets advanced generative AI research to redefine filmmaking, content (re)creation, visual storytelling, and beyond. 
  
## Our Missions
### Revolutionize filmmaking with video generative AI
Our foremost mission is to push the limits of video generative AI to power new creative possibilities. From realistic subject/scene generation to multimodal control and 3D grounding, we explore novel generation paradigms that fundamentally transform how stories are conceived and produced.
### Advance 4D neural reconstruction
We harness cutting-edge 4D neural representation and reconstruction techniques, enabling virtual production pipelines that capture objects, environments, and characters with unprecedented fidelity. Our methods streamline VFX and post-production workflows, making the impossible suddenly feasible.
### Empower storytellers and artists
By developing intuitive tools and user-friendly interfaces, we equip storytellers and artists to focus on their art, free from the constraints of outdated processes. Our AI-driven solutions ensure that imaginative ideas take center stage.
### Foster a global community of innovators
We believe that bold visions come from diverse perspectives. Our global community unites researchers, engineers, and creators dedicated to driving the future of VFX and virtual production through continuous experimentation and collaboration.
### Experiment, publish, and lead
We validate hypotheses through rigorous experimentation, share breakthroughs at top conferences, and contribute thought leadership that shapes our industryâ€™s future.

## Our team
Eyeline Research is teamed by researchers and developers who are unafraid to challenge the status quo. We partner with production teams, business stakeholders, and engineering experts to transfer cutting-edge R&D into real-world demonstrations. Our team is constantly growing and we welcome individuals who share our vision for advancing generative AI.
